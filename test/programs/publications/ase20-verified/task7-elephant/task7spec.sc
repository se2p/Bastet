/**
 * ## Task 7 "Elephantâ€œ
 *
 * Task: The `elephant` should `dance`.
 *
 * Rewrite as bounded safety property:
 *      The elephant must switch costumes at least every 2 seconds.
 *
 * Precondition:
 *      There exists one actors with the role of
 *      the elephant with a the name "Elefant1".
 *
 * Interpretations and considerations:
 *
 * Rewrite without explicit actor names:
 *    Given at max one actor it always changes its costume after a repaint (?)
 *
 *   EXISTS a in _RUNTIME_getAllActors():
 *     FORALL trace in PROGRAM_TRACES:
 *       IF time_elapsed > 2000:
 *           changed_costume(b) == TRUE
